# Race To Finals

This is a Game Boy Advanced game created as an assignment for my CS 2110 class. 
The class teaches about the basics of computing and discusses how a computer works. We discuss transistors, circuits, gates, finite state machines, the LC-3 computer, assembly, C, and more. 
The assignment was to explore C programming with a game.

## About the Game

This Game Boy Advanced game is about Sree who is late to his CS 2110 final. There is only one issue. He has to cross Ferst Drive, notorious for its terrible drivers! Your job is to get Sree safely across frst drive and to his final exam before the timer runs out. Can you do it? (I made this because I dreamed about missing my final last week)

## Game Attributes

When playing the game, you start on the left of the screen and have to cross the street to get to the final exam on the right. Cars are driving on both sides of the street, and any collision with them leads to you missing the final and failing the exam. You must reach the exam within the time limit to pass.

The game tracks your personal best as well as you number of wins and losses.
